# SQL Alchemy Challenge

This challenge was divided in two parts, with the focus being SQLAlchemy and Flask.

## Goals

The goals for each part of the challenge are listed below:

1. The first part focused on creating SQL queries via SQLAlchemy, saving the results in a panda data frame and finally, analyzing and plotting the results. We queried the SQL database and plotted the following:
    1. Overall precipitation data, along with a plot showing the precipitation data over date
    2. Total number of stations
    3. Most active station
    4. Lowest, highest and average temperatures for the most active station
    5. Temperature data for the last 12 months for the most active weather station, along with a histogram

2. The second part focused on Flask. Here, we created multiple API routes for the user to query a sql database for the following:
    1. Available API Routes
    2. Overall precipitation data for the last 12 months
    3. List of weather stations in the database
    4. Temperature data for the last 12 months for the most active weather station
    5. Lowest, highest and average temperatures in a given date range
